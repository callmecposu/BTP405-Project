## Workflow Conventions

- All the source code is located in this repo. Backend code is located in `/server` and the Frontend code is located in `/client` respectively.
- All the sensitive information goes into `.env` file that is `.gitignore` 'd. It must not be shared within GitHub but rather via private communication channels.
- When you are working on a new feature, you create a new branch from `main` for it. After finishing the work, you make a Pull Request. Example of the branch name: `server/feature/authorization` or `client/bugfix/search-bar`
